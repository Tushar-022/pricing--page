      "question": "How many users can use my chatbot?",

      "question": "How do I know how many characters are in my document?",

    {
      "question": "How do message credits work?",
      "answer": "One AI response with gpt-3.5-turbo (the default) costs 1 message credit. One AI response with gpt-4 costs 20 message credits. You can change which model your chatbot uses in the chatbot settings. The difference is because gpt-4 costs 15x (prompt tokens) and 30x (completion tokens) what gpt-3.5-turbo costs on OpenAI."
    },
    {
      "question": "When are my message credits renewed?",
      "answer": "Your message credits are renewed every month on the same date that you originally subscribed. So, if you subscribe on the 15th of March, your credits will be renewed on the 15th of April, and so on each month."
